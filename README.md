# Class Management - Frontend

I have created the frontend. All the states are managed by redux store. So all the data are temporary. When we refresh the page it will go away.

- To run the application clone the repository. Then

- ``cd class_management``

- `` npm install``

- `` npm run dev``


# Pages 

- Login Page
    - When you open the application. first you will be redirected to this page because the home is protected.
    You can go to the register page to create a new account. The userdata will remove if we refresh the application.

- Register Page

- Home page 
    - Where the scheduled classes display. You can also delete items.

- Add-New-Slot Page
- Cofirmation Modal
